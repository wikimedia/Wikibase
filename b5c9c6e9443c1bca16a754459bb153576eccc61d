The EntityHandler can have it injected via the constructor.\n\nAlso, as a rule of thumb, try to move as much logic as possible to EntityHandler. EntityContent should be as dumb as possible. It can just delegate to $this-\u003egetHandler()-\u003ewhatever.\n\nI realize the reference to WikibaseRepo was in here before, but introducing a factory seems the appropriate time for getting rid of that.",
