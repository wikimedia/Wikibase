      "message": "Hmm. I\u0027ve seen people do this a lot, with a fixme comment next to it. Not seen much resolving of those. So this strikes me as, \"I\u0027m doing it knowingly wrong now under the presence I will fix it later\".\n\nAlso, injecting more things is... well, this class already has 6 fields...\n\nProbably good to wrap the construction of ChangeOpClaim. This code here has no interest in that ChangeOpClaim needs the services now obtained via global state. This construction task really falls outside of the responsibility of this class.",
