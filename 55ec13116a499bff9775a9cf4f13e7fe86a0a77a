Looks like the GUID class got added after the validator, and did not steal all validation code yet. If the regex it contains gets move dthe the GUID class, then this line turns out to be redundant as expected",

So this strikes me as, \"I\u0027m doing it knowingly wrong now under the presence I will fix it later\".\n\nAlso, injecting more things is... well, this class already has 6 fields...\n\nProbably good to wrap the construction of ChangeOpClaim. This code here has no interest in that ChangeOpClaim needs the services now obtained via global state. This construction task really falls outside of the responsibility of this class.",
