      "message": "we\u0027ll probably also want getStatementsForProperty( $propId ) and similarly hasStatementsForProperty().\n\nMaybe it should even be getStatementsForProperty( $propId, $sourceId \u003d null ) so we can optionally filter by source. Seems nicer than implementing this filter in the API or even on the client. Source IDs however as still a hazy concept. They are not the same as reference hashes.",
