      "message": "the preferred language for the description should be the label\u0027s language. only if that doesn\u0027t exist, do a user-language based fallback.\n\nOr maybe... what if I look up labels in a language I don\u0027t speak? The I\u0027d appreciate descriptions in my own language. \n\nWell... needs more thought. My suggestion is to use the label\u0027s language for now and schedule a discussion on the details.",

I think we really need a discussion on how the language fallbacks should work.\n\nAfter some back and forth I left more or less the present solution in, but note that there will always be \"something\" now as the id will always be present.",
