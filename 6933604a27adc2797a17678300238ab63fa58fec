      "message": "Using this very generic query interface as the basis for all queries is convenient, but requires quite a bit of code to facilliate the abstraction, may generate non-optimal queries, and is probably only used in three or four ways.\n\nIt *is* kind of nice to have such a generic query function, and I guess we can use it for now. But please keep an eye out for the downsides of this kind of optimization.",
