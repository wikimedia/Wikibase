This is typically done via $wgCirrusSearchWikimediaExtraPlugin, but that of course can\u0027t be used here.\n\nmaybe it\u0027s not too important, and simply needs to be documented that wikibase integration with CirrusSearch requires the extra plugin",

      "message": "I think we need here to limit which qualifiers we consider. As I understood from David, we effectively will be summing up all quantity values using this analyzer. This means if we have more than one numeric value, it would just be added, which produces weird results - e.g. we could add \"ordinal number\" with \"quantity\". I think we need a config that defines which properties we are using. \n\nAlso we probably should have a generic config for enabling/disabling qualifier function, since it\u0027s much more relevant for SDC than Wikidata. Or may be the same config where empty means disabled.",
