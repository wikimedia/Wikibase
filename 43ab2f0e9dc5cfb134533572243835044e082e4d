      "message": "I realized we loose one bit of information if we remove all \u0026 here: This effectively documents which parameters *can* be passed back via a reference. However:\n\n* Documentation should not be done here but in docs/hooks.txt as well as https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Hooks/ParserGetVariableValueSwitch\n* I carefully looked at the code that calls this hook and I have *extreme* doubts any of these variables (except \u0026$ret, obviously) should ever be touched by a handler. You can swap the $parser with an other one! Luckily this does nothing. Swapping the cache will mess up the internal state of the parser, with unknown consequences (hopefully no negative ones). Swapping the $index also messes with the cache, with unexpected results pretty much guaranteed.",
