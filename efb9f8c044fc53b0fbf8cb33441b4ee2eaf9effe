      "message": "For dispatching, you would only need the entity type, not the ID, right? Then why ask for the ID?\n\nAs to making the ID (or the type) part of EntityContentDiff: I don\u0027t see the need for much refactoring. Add a constructor argument. There is only one place in production ocde where EntityContentDiff is instantiated: in EntityContent::getDiff. And EntityContent knows the type and ID.\n\nThere is 13 calls to the constructor in tests, in 5 classes. A bit anyoing, but not horrible. And no actual refactoring needed to introduce the information.",
