      "message": "I’m curious about this line. As far as I understand, Special:PagesWithBadges doesn’t make sense as a querypage API parameter either, because it requires a parameter to return pages (the badge). But unlike EntityUsage, PagesWithBadges is not available for the qppage parameter anyways, and if you try to use it [1], you’ll just get an “unrecognized value for parameter” error. So perhaps we should investigate a bit why PagesWithBadges is not available even though it’s listed here, and make EntityUsage unavailable via the same mechanism instead of removing it from here?\n\n[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action\u003dquery\u0026list\u003dquerypage\u0026qppage\u003dPagesWithBadges",
