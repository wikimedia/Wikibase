      "message": "There actually is a limit to the limit. How the offset works unfortunately is completely unclear from this documentation. At first look I expected a behavior similar to MySQLs \"LIMIT offset,count\", but when looking at the array_slice code and how the array is constructed this is obviously not the case.",
