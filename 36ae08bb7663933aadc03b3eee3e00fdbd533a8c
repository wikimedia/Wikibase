      "message": "This is an executable script, so traditionally, it should start with a lower-case letter, like scripts in maintenance/. \n\nBy convention, a lower case letter indicates a verb (e.g. method names), an upper case letter indicates a noun (e.g. class names). To me that\u0027s very intuitive, since in German, all nouns are written with a capital letter :)",

It\u0027s a bit messy, I have some patches lying around for cleaning that up. Let me know if you run into trouble.\n\nOn the other hand, we could also use a fake ChangeDispatchCoordinator. The objective of this test is to test the lock manager, not the coordinator.",
