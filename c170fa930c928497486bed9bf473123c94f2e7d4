      "message": "Such a convention may exist but I\u0027m not aware of it at the moment. My personal convention is:\n* Always use short names.\n* Long names /can/ be used if a class name is /not/ used in code but in comments only. Like it is here.\n\nReasoning:\n\nWikibaseRepo does not /really/ depend on EntityStoreWatcher. PHP doesn\u0027t care what .getEntityStoreWatcher() returns. The only reason to mention EntityStoreWatcher is to have nice hints in the IDE.\n\nThe benefit of having a single comment that\u0027s a bit longer is a more meaningful \"use\" section.",
