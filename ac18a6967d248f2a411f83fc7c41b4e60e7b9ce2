      "message": "As I said before: I find the \"handle\" names unhelpful. And I find a bunch of methods working on a property strange. Look at this line: $this-\u003ehandleSnak( $snak )? What does this do? It\u0027s impossible to tell based on this signature. All knowledge is hidden in side effects.\n\nTL:DR: It\u0027s possible to do the same with way less side effects.",

      "message": "I agree with Thiemo: accumulating data in a member just to return it is bad. The Finder should either be stateless, or should be a builder-style class, with a \"addLinksFromSnaks\" method and a \"getLinks\" method.\n\nBut a statefull builder needs a factory, so we can create new instances on the fly (we can\u0027t use \"new\", since then we\u0027d have to know about all the services the finder depends on). That seems unnecessary. Much easier to have a stateless finder, and just build the result on the stack.",
