(e.g. everything included)\n\narray_diff means returning an empty array with no valid namespaces, whereas in fact, all namespaces are enabled.  If we really want an array of all namespaces, then we\u0027d need to provide the checker with more knowledge of the client namespaces.\n\nexclude namespaces takes precedent over \"include\" namespace (and the include \"namespace\" setting is deprecated)",
