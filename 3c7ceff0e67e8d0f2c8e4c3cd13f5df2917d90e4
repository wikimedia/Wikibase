      "message": "Looking at usage of this class I wonder: is it going to be necessary/intended to have ItemDiffVisualizer instance that uses instance X of say message localizer (or any other of services passed in the constructor), while the basic visualizer it uses would use instance Y of the same service?\n\nWhat I mean is, that if both basic and item visualizer are intended to use same services, maybe even injecting basic visualizer is not necessary, and it could created here?\n\nOTOH, I see type hinting against EntityDiffVisualizer - this would mean injecting the visualizer is actually intended. But is it really intended to pass any diff visualizer instance here?",
