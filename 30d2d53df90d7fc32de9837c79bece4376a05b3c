      "message": "What getNativeData returns is really not relevant, because there is no code that does anything with it, except this one here. getSize should:\n* never return 0.\n* return a number that is as close as possible to the actual size of the entity blob in the database.\n\nThis means:\n* getNativeData should either return a JSON string or the serialized array structure, as it does now. Returning the entity object is not ideal, but is \"better than nothing\" as a fallback.\n* getSize should be changed to use json_encode instead of serialize. This is already tracked in T157673.",
