Unless I get it wrong this results in trimming $exactSearchResults to have no more than $limit entries in it, and puts the result into $allSearchResults.\nBut isn\u0027t at this point $exactSearchResults for sure not bigger than $limit? So couldn\u0027t this just be $allSearchResults \u003d $exactSearchResults?\n\nOr could it be that $exactSearchResults can have multiple entries per entity ID, thus it is still kind of \"flattened\" in mergeSearchResults?",
