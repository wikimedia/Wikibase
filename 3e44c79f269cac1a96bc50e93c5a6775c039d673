      "message": "It seems that in some languages the correct form is j xg Y (Ru/Cs... + Ar/He...) while in other j F Y is correct, and that the other format is not only \"not correct\" but wrong. I think of the following possible solutions:\n1. Configuration by language - it may give the same result as 1, but requires configuration work for each language. the benefit is that we can make sure the parser support those formats... the default can be j F Y to preserve the current behavior and I\u0027ll add configuration for j xg Y for all the relevant languages that use this format.\n2. use \u0027january-date\u0027/\u0027february-date\u0027... messages - this should be correct but almost sure the formatter wouldn\u0027t be consistent with the parser in some languages.\n\nI would like to hear better suggestions :)",

      "message": "The fundamental problem here is that the date pattern needs to be defined per-language, and not hard coded as we currently have it. That could be done simply by taking it from a localizable message. The Language object also has functions for date formatting, which we should probably re-use here if possible (not sure that the functionality in MediaWiki core can deal with BC, etc). \n\nIn any case, changing the hard coded month name to using the genitive form makes things worse, not better. In several \"big\" languages, the result is simply wrong.",

      "message": "This is better for languages that use a suffix to indicate the genitive. Shoudl work for European languages, at least. But maybe in some languages it\u0027s the other way around? Can you survey the translation files and see if there is any language where the genitive of a month name is actually a prefix in the nominative form of the month name?\n\nI would feel better though if this would replace only full words, that is, consider word boundaries. That would mean doing some regex magic, I suppose...",
