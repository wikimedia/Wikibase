      "message": "I am also against creating a separate extension for each tiny module. No strong opinion about Diff and Ask, they seem rather big, but this is clearly part of Wikibase and the separation of Lib, Repo and Client is more than enough already.\n\nVisitors of the Wiki will just get confused if there are tons of extensions displayed which do not really have a visible effect for the user.\n\nI could stuff each of our more generic jQuery widgets into its own extension. I could even stuff each resource loader module into its own extension and we would be above 50 extensions for Wikibase soon.\n\nIf you have separate components, put them into a separate directory and ship it with a separate file which does nothin than returning an array with the file names when included somewhere. That\u0027s flexible enough if someone really wants to use those components separately.",

      "message": "This component is not particularly small. It is bigger then a lot of MW extensions.\n\nSpecial:Version is meant to list the versions of all software installed. Since this component has a version, it should be listed there.\n\nWe have 7 components in Wikibase right now, which is counting repo, lib and client. This might increase a little, but is not going to get to 50.\n\nI do not understand your last paragraph.\n\nIn any case, I want to be able to see which version of this component is installed. Right now I cannot do this. It is not because right now the version numbers of lib,repo,client and datamodel are all the same, that this will remain true. And keep in mind that DataModel does not depend on any of these. It can be used on its own, for instance by an extension that interacts with some wikibase repo and needs to represent entities. What if there is a bug there? How are the users going to report which version they are using? Look at the code?",

      "message": "I am just saying low level components should not be listed as an extension with higher level concept extensions that are actually relevant for the users of the wiki. As a user of some wiki I go to special version to see what extensions are installed and to seek their documentation pages to see what features I can use within that wiki. To have that page flooded with low level components which are used by other extensions but which do not have any real value for the user is just annoying and seems ridiculous.\n\nI know that this is a problem of core, but as long as the problem exists, I would rather not work around it like that.\n\nIf your only concern is that you want to see the version number of those components right now, then perhaps creating a dynamic extension description for \"real\" extensions which will hold information about their usage of those components could be a less invasive workaround",

      "message": "Why are you complaining here, while we already have the same for Diff, Ask and DataValues? How are those different? Do you suggest we also remove the version info of those?\n\nListing the version of all components used by a certain extension in its description is just stupid. That will create lots of duplication and is more an abuse of Special:Version then registering these components IMO. Plus it breaks component encapsulation.\n\nThe enemy of the good is the perfect. IMO you are being perfectionistic here, and blocking the obvious pragmatic approach, demanding to go for a solution you know very well is not going to happen. And wasting time on something that is a non-issue while we have serious things to do.",
