      "message": "This code scares me a bit, because it heavily obfuscates what this query will actually do in the end. I followed the code paths and believe this is what the WHERE will contain:\n\n term_language\n term_type\n term_text\n term_search_key\n term_entity_id\n term_entity_type\n term_full_entity_id\n\nThis is the order in the WHERE.\n\nThere are a lot of keys on the wb_terms table. Which one will be used for this query?\n\nNote that this WHERE contains both the old term_entity_type + term_entity_id combination, as well as the new term_full_entity_id. This is redundant, and probably makes the query slower than it needs to be.\n\nNote that term_entity_type is *not* in any index that combines two or more fields. It\u0027s only in its own \"wb_terms_entity_type\" index.",
