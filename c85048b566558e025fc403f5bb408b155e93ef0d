      "message": "Hm. I understand what this does and why it\u0027s here. However, this looks really complicated and hard to maintain. Can we move this to a helper function, e.g. wb.utilities.ui.buildParentheses( $content ) or wb.utilities.ui.buildPendingCounterWithParentheses() or add an option to the existing function?\n\nSure, this should be done in an other patch.",

      "message": "Hm. I think we should discuss this shortly. Two points:\n* I had the impression we have a convention to use wb-... as a prefix. This will be the first exception, as far as I know. Personally I think we should stick to wb-...\n* I understand changing the \"sitelinks\" part to \"sitelinklistview\" is a very good idea because it will be the same as the JS class/file. However, is breaking compatibility really worth it? The DOM did not changed much, as far as I can see.",
