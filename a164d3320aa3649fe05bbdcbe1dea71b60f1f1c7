The main difference is that a EntityCotnent can represent a redirect, while an EntityDocument cannot.\n\nAlso: is the entity given the \"old\" or the \"new\" entity? Typically, a diff is between different revisions of an entity, but it is possible to create a diff between different entities, too.\n\nFor now, I recommend to include on the information we actually need: the entity type.",
