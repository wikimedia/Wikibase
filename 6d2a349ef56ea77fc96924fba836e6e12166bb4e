      "message": "This list is currently associative array indexed by entity type name. It\u0027s fine but do we really needed it? I\u0027ve briefly looked at patch using the factory in RdfBuilder and there the only thing that\u0027s important is that there is an array of EntityRdfBuilders. It doesn\u0027t need to be associative. But maybe I missed some other usages of this.",

      "message": "I\u0027d still suggest to have instanceof check or something. Docs still say callbacks can return null. If this is allowed at least !\u003d\u003d null check should be here IMO. But generally it seems to me it is no point in allow null to be returned. Instead, you could say callbacks must return EntityRdfBuilder, and have instanceof check here leading to big error if callback returns something else.",
