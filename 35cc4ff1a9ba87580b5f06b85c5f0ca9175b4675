      "message": "Why rename these?\n\nI don\u0027t feel like bikesheding about names and don\u0027t mind the change if others like the new name better.\nTo me \"builder\" kind of suggests the thing is an object, here we have callables.\nAlso, I know in Wikibase multiple kind of things are called builders but when I hear builder I always think about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern too.",

      "message": "What the callback *represents* was not obvious before. The old variable name said \"…callback\", which is the technical format of the thing, and \"$deserializerFactory…\", which is the place where the thing is meant to be used.\n\nIn contrast, the new variable name describes what the callback does: it builds a deserializer.\n\nThe short scope is key here. I don\u0027t suggest to name the public getter \"get…Builders\" if it returns callbacks. But here the scope of the short \"$builder\" variable is literally 2 lines of code, and the scope of the longer \"$deserializerBuilders\" 4 lines. It\u0027s still entirely obvious we are dealing with callbacks here, both because the getter is called \"get…Callbacks\", and because of the \"call_user_func\" call 4 lines later.",
