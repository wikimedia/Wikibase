      "message": "I am wondering whether there will be ever a need to use some more specialized id parser (ie. so this would become injected in the constructor). The only case I could think of was a case when a prefix of a federated wiki was added, and prefix mapping should be applied. In such case we\u0027d rather need PrefixMappingEntityIdParser. But such case does not seem muc realistic (using foreign items as badges sounds a bit iffy), so I guess this is fine. Making the comment, as maybe others have some thoughts on this.",
