And I want to be able to pass ItemId objects if I already have some, again both as a single object and an array.\n\nNote this is not datamodel code. That code actually does what you suggests and only accepts arrays if ItemId objects. But this would be very tedious here. This is a builder only meant to be used in tests.",
