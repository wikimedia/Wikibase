The current status is that this extensions PHP interfaces may not be used by
other extensions. None of the PHP apis have any stability guarantees. An
exception are extensions that fully cover these usages with unit tests which
are run by the CI pre-merge and are integrated in the Wikidata build.

TODO:

Explain how this extension can be used by other Mediawiki exstension,
which type of public APIs there are (HTTP API, Mediawiki hooks, composer
components, PHP classes, etc) and what stability guarantees are available and
how these are annotated on the individual parts (e.g. class level docs).
