= Extending entities =

This is a checklist of things that need doing when adding a new field to an existing entity type. For example if you want to add “NewThingy” part to entity type called “Foo”:

* Add a provider interface, such as NewThingyProvider, for the new field.
* Add to entity as an attribute and add getter and setter (implement the provider interface)
* Add to Special:NewFoo if needed upon creation
* Consider in equals() method of the Entity
* Consider in __clone() method of the Entity
* Consider in isEmpty() method of the Entity
* Add support to FooSerializer
* Add support to FooDeserializer
* Add support to FooPatcher
* Add support to FooDiffer
* Add support in FooView (implements EntityDocumentView)
* Add a ChangeOp for the new field, e.g. NewThingyChangeOp, and the related ChangeOpDeserializer, e.g. NewThingyChangeOpDeserializer
* Add support in FooValidatorFactory
* Add support in FooChangeOpDeserializer
* Add support in FooRdfBuilder

''CAVEAT'' (as of January 2017): For the below parts of Wikibase, there are no extension interfaces yet for handling additional fields of entities. Fields of entity types known to Wikibase itself can be hardcoded here, but for supporting entity types defined in other extensions, plug-in interfaces still need to be added.

* Add handling (or suppression) to EntityChangeFactory (not currently pluggable)
* Add handling to EntityDiffVisualizer (not currently pluggable)
