They expect the original value as stated in the database. Which is \"null\" or \"undefined\". Not \"1 second\". This is still misleading, even with the additional \"auto\" hint.\n\nI still think this must be omitted. At least set it to 0.",

      "message": "Original value as stated in the database is useless for RDF users. They would need something to work with set of coordinates, and \"null\" is not going to work for them - they\u0027d have to write additional parsing code to weed out these nulls, as no geo-data system is going to accept the value of \"null\". In fact, this value is explicitly treated as broken by the PHP code (try editing such coordinate - you\u0027ll get 1/3600). So we need to give the users something useful there, not \"what is in the database\" - RDF is not meant to be a database dump.",
