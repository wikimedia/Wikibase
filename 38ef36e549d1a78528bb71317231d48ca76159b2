      "message": "It was in EntityContent, which is worse; it should go into a factory, but not in this patch. Having it here means EntityContent subclasses no longer rely on services (though they still access \"their\" ContentHandler - can\u0027t really avoid that at the moment).\n\nAlternatively, this code could stay in EntityContent, and be factored out into a factory from there at some point. But I really want to get at least the Content classes cleaned up now.",

      "message": "I agree it does not belong into EntityContent. However, neither do it belong here. Seems like you moved it here just because EntityContent happens to have an instance of this class. Putting code that does not belong here because it does also not belong somewhere else is just moving the problem. How is putting it into a new class to begin with more work?",

I can\u0027t fix all the lose ends at once.\nNote that EntityHandler will need to have a getEntityView method anyway, it will just delegate the call to a factory that is injected via the constructor. So, I just inlined the factory code for now, to me moved later (see the @todo)",
