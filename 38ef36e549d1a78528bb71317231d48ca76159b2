Having it here means EntityContent subclasses no longer rely on services (though they still access \"their\" ContentHandler - can\u0027t really avoid that at the moment).\n\nAlternatively, this code could stay in EntityContent, and be factored out into a factory from there at some point. But I really want to get at least the Content classes cleaned up now.",
