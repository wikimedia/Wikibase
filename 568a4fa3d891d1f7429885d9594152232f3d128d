      "message": "True, but building a regex from the actual entity ids would be tricky, and this is inclusive enough that it will probably cover most kinds of IDs.\n\nHowever, In order to handle something like L12345-F3 or L3455/S6 in the future, an additional step would be needed. Just allowing - and / as part of the id won\u0027t work, since then we\u0027d mis-match wiki/Q1234.\n\nPerhaps add a comment to that effect.",
