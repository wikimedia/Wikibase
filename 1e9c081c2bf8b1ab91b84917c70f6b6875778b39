I can make it use strpos if you say it fits better in this case (I am not sure as we assume in most cases it is not going to start with the given prefix).\n\n \u003e This is a bit overengeneering. \n\nI was asked to put in the private method (to be accurate it was a substr code before). I guess I can only satisfy only one of the preferred ways :)",

What else could it check before grabbing the part of the id from the title text?\n\n \u003e The strlen is also pointless with a fixed string.\n\nIt is a fixed string indeed. I didn\u0027t put a number there as it would be a bit confusing IMO to suddenly see 19 in there. Do you think it should use a number and explain what happens in the comment?",
