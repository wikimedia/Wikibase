The magic trick that was happening in the old code was this:\n* The $props array contained PropertyId objects.\n* These object happened to be used in a context where they are casted to strings.\n* __toString returns the IDs serialization, just as getSerialization.\n\nThe new code avoids this magic behavior and makes $props an array of strings.",
