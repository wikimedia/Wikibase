      "message": "Joining the page table is expensive. The EntityTitleLookup service should be used to derive a Title from an EntityId. That would also eliminate the need for joining wb_entity_per_page.\n\nNote that the EntityTitleLookup (currently/per default) uses a programmatic mapping, so no database lookups are involved. If that was not the case, the join may be the best option.",
