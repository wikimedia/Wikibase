      "message": "So a ReferencedFinder will always return strings? That seems a bit inflexible. As a first step, it would be nice to be able to get a list of DataValues. Converting to strings can be done in a second step, if desired, but ReferencedFinder probably shouldn\u0027t know about that.",

      "message": "I propose to use composition instead of subclassing, unless there are situations where a caller would call an unknown kind of ReferenceFinder, which might be a ReferencedImageFinder. But that seems unlikely, since the caller needs to know how to interpret the strings returned by the finder.",
