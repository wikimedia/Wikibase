However, I still think more detail could be added.\n\n\u003e But when I look at the code it seems the opposite is true: the code tried to unregister stuff with the index -1.\n\nWell, this, and it would also never have unregistered stuff with the index 0, since 0 is not “truthy”. That sounds like it could be a common case (though I haven’t looked at the code in detail to understand it).",
