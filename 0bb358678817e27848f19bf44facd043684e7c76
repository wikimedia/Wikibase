      "message": "Just a GuidGenerator would not require those dependencies. Since there is a Claim specific guid generator, those two should be splitted into two files so that the one without any dependencies can be in its own module without those dependencies.\n\nThis makes it more transparent and therefore easier to see the dependencies if the guid generator should be moved for example into mw core or its own library wherever.",
