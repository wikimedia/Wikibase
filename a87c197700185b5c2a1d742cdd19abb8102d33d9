      "message": "Yep, that\u0027s the conventional way. setUp is parent first , tearDown should be parent last. That way the encapsulation is balanced, like A-setup, B-setup, B-teardown, A-teardown. The previous code was a mistake and could\u0027ve failed in theory (e.g. if the parent method had its own reservations about Language:$mLangObjCache). Albeit unlikely in this case.",
