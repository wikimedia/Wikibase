      "message": "I\u0027m fine with this code in the sense that it won\u0027t produce any error ;)\n\nHowever I can\u0027t really speak to the business logic of the \u0027page-connection\u0027 notification.\n\nI\u0027m not sure why some EchoEvents don\u0027t have a title. Looking at the code[1], it looks like events are just not created without a title. There might be a different code path creating these notifications that I haven\u0027t seen.\n\nIt\u0027s also possible that the title is not available in the replica yet, in which case `$event-\u003egetTitle (true );` would be needed to read it from master but it would be wise to add instrumentation as a first step before spreading \"read from master\" left and right.\n\n[1] https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/g/mediawiki/extensions/Wikibase/+/57a5d0f8703dbf562e758e768f733de6db063ecf/client/includes/Hooks/EchoNotificationsHandlers.php#166",
