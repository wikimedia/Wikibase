      "message": "To me this just makes the code more confusing, we are making use of a language feature, but using it for something that it was not intended.\nAnyone that knows PHP knows about this language feature and what it does and then looks at this and says, why is it doing that? it doesn\u0027t need to.\n\nI wouldn\u0027t really call it a dig into newRevisionLookup either, that method is 5 lines long and its pretty clear what it does.\n\nIf we really want to hint here about what the parameter being passed into the function is for then let\u0027s use a less confusing phpdoc comment instead of assigning a variable?\nBut I still don\u0027t really see the need of this hint, are we going to start doing this everywhere?\nCan we just look at the function definition that we are calling instead?",
