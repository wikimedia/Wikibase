      "message": "Agree, when a method returns a SiteLink it is expected it returns the whole SiteLink. Not doing so is odd and should be clearly documented. Though you\u0027d likely be better off making a new object that properly represents the info you are dealing with then.\n\nSecond issue with this comment: it talks about the implementation rather than specifying the contract of the method. This information is something you can put in the class docs of the class implementing the interface in a specific way, though in most cases you can make this clear enough with the class name. Here you do not have a dedicated interface, and just have a class that thus cannot describe itself in such a way. Still, the callers of this method should very likely not even know there is such a thing as a repository application, so having it in the docs here is bad.",
