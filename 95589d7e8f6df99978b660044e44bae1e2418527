What you are pointing at here is mostly refactoring and some minor performance bits. Separating this feels weird. I believe this is not what we should do in general. Boyscout rule: always leave the code in a better shape than you found it. That\u0027s what I did here.\n\nAt the same time I tried hard to minimize the diff. I always do this since about a year now.",
