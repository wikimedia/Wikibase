      "message": "This can happen, but not \"always\".\n\nFrom what I see now (thanks to Lucas\u0027 explanation) there are two issues:\n* The widget that was added first (at index 0) can never be unregistered.\n* When called with a widget that was never registered (or is unregistered already), the code will indeed remove the last array element.\n\nAll this is mostly hypothetical at this point. I believe the method is not even called in real-life situations, and if it is, it is only called with known widgets, which means the -1 situation never really happens.",
