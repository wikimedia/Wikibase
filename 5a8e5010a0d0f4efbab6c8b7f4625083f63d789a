I know you don\u0027t like it, but it\u0027s pretty much universally understood as a placeholder.\n\nHowever, I agree that the list above doesn\u0027t really say how or where to add support. We should change that. And \"add support to\" is misleading - it\u0027s really \"create class\".",

      "message": "This is not about me not liking \"Foo\" (which is true). Let\u0027s say I consider the first paragraph in this document and understand that \"Foo\" is the name of an entity type. I can find, for example, …Differ, …Serializer, …View, and so on for all existing entity types. But I can not find any …ValidatorFactory for any of the existing entity types.\n\nI strongly believe that all these \"add support to\" lines are bad. For example, to add a new \"Foo\" entity type, I need to \"add support\" to FooSerializer? What does this mean? Add \"support\" for what? Where? It probably means I need to *create* a FooSerializer, because I can see other …Serializer exist. But where do I need to add my new serializer then?",
