      "message": "The parent Action::__constructor says \"Page\". This is what I repeated here.\n\nThe field Action::$page where the value ends is documented as \"WikiPage|Article|ImagePage|CategoryPage|Page\", see https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/source/mediawiki/browse/master/includes/actions/Action.php$44\n\nThe only common base class for all these is, as far as I\u0027m aware of, Page.\n\nSo yea, I understand your comment and share the concerns about these somewhat weird type hints in the Action class. But this is an issue of the Action class, and should not block this patch.",
