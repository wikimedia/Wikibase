      "message": "I know this might be splitting the code from another fail class, though nevertheless this is not good code.\n\nIt has two public methods that do something completely different, and has a class description that suggests other methods that happen to do anything vaguely related to \"entities\" should go in here as well. Also note how both methods need a different service to operate. The first one needs an id parser, while the second one needs an entity content factory. What if I need the second method? Why do I need to provide an id parser?\n\nSRP violation, OCP violation, ISP violation...\n\nWhat for? To not repeat 3 lines of code 5 times? This likely is more actual code, more complexity and definitely more spaghetti.\n\n\"FooHelper\" is a class name screaming you are doing something wrong.",
