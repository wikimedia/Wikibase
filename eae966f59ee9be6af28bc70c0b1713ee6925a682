      "message": "I find the placement of this line very confusing. I would expect this in the constructor, and replace all occurrences of $entityDataFormatProvider with $this-\u003eentityDataFormatProvider. As far as I can see this service is always needed: when the special page is called with parameters, as well as when called without.\n\nThe dependency injection can be done in a later patch, but the placement of this line should be fixed in this patch.",
