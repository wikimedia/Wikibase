      "message": "Do we really need to make a \"Service\" out of a function that cleans up dates? It looks like overdesigning to me. It\u0027s just cleaning dates, what\u0027s the chance you\u0027d ever need to have two of them? For doing what - cleaning dates in two different ways? Why? It\u0027s not a service, it\u0027s just utility function that should be by right private to the builder because nobody else needs it. But you want it as a class, fine. But making it a \"Service\" goes too far. We already have like 10-parameter constructors and it\u0027s impossible to find where things are actually being created. But we definitely not need this for a couple of functions that clean dates.",
