      "message": "I think that limit is too low for languages. We want to catch cases where people go through *everything*. 10 modifiers would still be a very useful filter for change dispatching. \n\nFor statements, we\u0027d ideally want the limit to be relative to the total number of statements on the entity. We have that in page_props, right? But loading that would probably be overkill. 10 may be an OK-ish limit for that.\n\nAnyway, we\u0027ll want different limits for different aspects.",
