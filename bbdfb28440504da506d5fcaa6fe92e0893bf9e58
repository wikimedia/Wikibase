      "message": "You are right - in theory, we don\u0027t. \n\nWe do need to wait for replication before releasing the lock. And depending on what kind of lock we use, we need a connection in order to release it. \n\nSo... in practice, doing the wait after the release would probably still work, because it would end up using the same connection anyway, if needed. But it\u0027s nicer to make this explicit.",
