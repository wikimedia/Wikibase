      "message": "The test is the same as at line 421 (selectTerms), so I think it make sense to use the same test here. Yes it is brittle as in \"will not work if there are no other box\".\n\nWe made a decision to use Babel for this purpose and to get that information in a very specific way. I think the general idea is good but how we get the information from the Babel extension is wrong. A more general solution would be to get this information from the preferences, as this is user specific and not Babel specific.\n\nIn my opinion the Babel extension should make this information available in some generic way, now it is available as a special feature given the existence of the Babel extension. This should be fixed, but the fix must first be available in the Babel extension.\n\nAnother way to build the toc is to peek into the generated html and strip out what we want, but that has other problems as we stuff the entries with unrelated content that does not belong in the toc. Not to say that not all sections have valid headers.",
