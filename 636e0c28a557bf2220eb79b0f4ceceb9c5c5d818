      "message": "Oh, when we were discussing that using those traits would require to test classes to have an interface providing entity object and the change op deserializer object I didn\u0027t think of having the actual PHP interface :) But it doesn\u0027t hurt to have it guess.\n\nI wonder how clear the intention of this interface is for people not really knowing the context. I can get what\u0027s going on here but I\u0027d leave it for others to comment on this.",
