      "message": "If this module is only responsible for a single config variable, then perhaps it should have a more specific name? RepoAccessModule above seems a bit more directly related to a wbRepo variable.\n\nOn the other hand, weâ€™re supposed to use less and larger ResourceLoader modules as far as I know, because having a highly fragmented module hierarchy hurts performance, so perhaps these should also be consolidated into a single module that exports several variables. But that can also be done later.",
