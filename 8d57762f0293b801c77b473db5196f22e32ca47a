      "message": "Now we have 3 bool parameters in a row. It\u0027s only on a private method and therefor not that much of a problem, but still worth thinking about it, in my opinion.\n\nThe descriptions of these two parameters sound like this should be a single parameter with 3 string constants instead.\n\nWait. Why are there two parameters that both say something about if stuff is in data or object form? This sounds like *all* 3 bool parameters can be merged into a single string parameter.\n\nAfter playing around with the code myself I realized this would result in 6 different string constants. I came up with something I think is reasonable and will upload it as a follow up.",
