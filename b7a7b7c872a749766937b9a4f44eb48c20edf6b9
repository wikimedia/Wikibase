      "message": "In this case the change replaces the class name \"wb-mainsnak\" with \"wb-snakview\". I\u0027m not sure if it\u0027s a good idea to remove it. \"MainSnak\" is a common term in the code base. Don\u0027t you think it makes sense to have an easy way to distinguish the main snakview from other snakviews? What about class\u003d\"wb-snakview wb-mainsnak\"? I\u0027m aware it\u0027s not really needed. One can simply use longer CSS selectors to do the same. But I think it\u0027s convenient to have it, especially for user CSS.",
