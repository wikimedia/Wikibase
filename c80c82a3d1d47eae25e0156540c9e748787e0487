      "message": "Is there a reason to check the flag in this file, and not in `ExternallyRenderedEntityViewPlaceholderExpander`? It seems wrong to me that the request inspector would claim \"this is a default request!\" because of the flag, even if it might not be a default request by our definition. `ExternallyRenderedEntityViewPlaceholderExpander` seems the better option since its responsibility is to perform the second request, so it seems natural to also prevent it there.",
