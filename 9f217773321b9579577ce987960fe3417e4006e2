      "message": "I assume this is supposed to strip whitespace before and after colons. This is wrong for two reasons:\n\n1) this will remove the colon itself, too. \"2001: A Space Odysee\" will become \"2001A Space Odysee\".\n\n2) Even if it would preserve the colon (using a lookahead/lookbehind), it would still be wrong: \"2001: A Space Odysee\" would become \"2001:A Space Odysee\", which is not correct.\n\nThis kind of stripping must only be applied if we *know* we are dealing with a namespace prefix. We can\u0027t know that here. In fact, we don\u0027t even know whether we are dealing with a page title at all, or a label, a description, or whatever.",
