The main cause is that I don\u0027t think that caching will help us here really, because why would the same file name being validated twice in a short period?",

      "message": "Depends. When users start typing, short file names like \"a\", \"b\", and so on are probably validated every day.\n\nWhen a user adds a series of images with similar file names, e.g. \"Coats of arms of X.svg\", prefixes like \"Coats\", \"Coats of arms\", and so on are probably validated a few dozen times in a short period.\n\nCurrently all this can not happen because we have a regex validator that checks for a file extension.\n\nFor performance reasons it\u0027s probably a good idea to make this regex validator more specific. There is a TODO for this in our code.",
