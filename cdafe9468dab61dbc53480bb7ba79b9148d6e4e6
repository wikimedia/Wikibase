It\u0027s annoying, but we can\u0027t just change it without a clear migration path. Note that the changes table is a communication channel between the repo and the client, and is thus often accessed by different versions of Wikibase at the same time. It\u0027s also a buffer, so even if client and repo were updated at once.",
