      "message": "This is hidden by CSS if the user doesn\u0027t have JS enabled. I agree that there should be some kind of no-js link, but just linking special:createitem wont work: A page without sitelinks *can* have an item (which then only has one sitelink or only one sitelink to the current sitegroup). Handling that is doable, but should probably be a different change.",
