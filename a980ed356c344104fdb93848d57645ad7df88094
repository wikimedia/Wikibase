      "message": "I’m trying to wrap my head around this, but it’s not working very well :D\n\nI think this would make more sense if DataAccessSettings was an interface, and the current class was one implementation (perhaps called StaticDataAccessSettings), but there could also be other implementations – for example, the current class is usually initialized with the same snippet of $settings-\u003eget( \u0027four settings for four constructor arguments\u0027 ), so an alternative implementation could just accept a single Settings object and deduplicate that logic.\n\nBut even then, I don’t see the point of mocking the interface when a perfectly suitable real implementation is already available (StaticDataAccessSettings). Unless, perhaps, you want to ensure that only certain settings are accessed, and throw an exception if any other getter is called?",
