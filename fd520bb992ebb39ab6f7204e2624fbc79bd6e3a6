      "message": "I wonder whether it would read \"better\" if the PropertyDataTypeLookup param came after EntityTitleLookup. Now it kind of comes out the sudden, there is a language list, list of entity types, a base URI, and suddenly, a property data type lookup. I\u0027d expect services coming togeter, then some other stuff. Or the other way round.\nJust a personal opinion, not saying it is generally better neither asking to change. And this can change later.\n\nThiemo, what do you think?",

But I had the same idea: it would feel better to have this new parameter either before or after the title lookup.\n\nDon\u0027t forget to rearrange the assignment, PHPDoc line and property accordingly if you move this.",
