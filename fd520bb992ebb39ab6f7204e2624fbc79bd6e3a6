Now it kind of comes out the sudden, there is a language list, list of entity types, a base URI, and suddenly, a property data type lookup. I\u0027d expect services coming togeter, then some other stuff. Or the other way round.\nJust a personal opinion, not saying it is generally better neither asking to change. And this can change later.\n\nThiemo, what do you think?",
