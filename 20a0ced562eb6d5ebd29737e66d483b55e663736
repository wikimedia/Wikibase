      "message": "Why the modulo operation? The following would be clearer.\n\n $c++;\n if ( $c \u003d\u003d\u003d this-\u003edbBatchSize ) {\n }\n\nThe current code goes through here on every operation. If in the future that won\u0027t be the case, a better defence would be to instead evaluate \"$c \u003e\u003d $batchSize\". Given it will reset to 0 in this block, matching only the exact iteration seems fragile, which is at odds with the purpose of catching an iteration that may\u0027ve skipped the logic.\n\nWhat am I missing :)",
