I\u0027ll change to 406 later today, but I am fine someone anyone who feels confident changes the patch to use different code and merge it.\n\nActually, Tpt, when using 406 code, the message shouldn\u0027t probably say \"use JSON instead\"? Per \"and that the server is unwilling to supply a default representation.\" part of the code definition.",

If there were only a JSON encoding for all Wikibase entities, then returning it would have made sense because it would be more an intended behavior.\n\nMy error code suggestion is more or less \"bikeshedding\" imho so feel free to not edit your change and keep the 400 code if you prefer.",
