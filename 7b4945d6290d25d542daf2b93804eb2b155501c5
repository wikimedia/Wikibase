      "message": "I would expect a scenario like this to read like a story, written from a users perspective. In other words, I expect this to be written in a way that I can read it aloud, and each step does make so much sense to me that I can follow it manually, step by step. The problem here is that I don\u0027t know what I would need to do to \"ignore browser errors\". Does this refer to exceptions in the JS console? Doesn\u0027t this typically end all JS on a page? How can I continue then?\n\nTL;DR: I hope we can find a better wording for this step. Maybe something like \"And I am going to continue in case of JavaScript errors\"? Or \"And JavaScript errors are not going to stop me\"?",
