This feature is experimental.

You need to have a Solr instance running on the standard port.
The schema.xml file describes an example schema for the
Solr instance.

You also need to have Solarium available. Add a local setting
$wgWBSolarium = "../../path/to/solarium/Autoloader.php";

In your local settings you can then switch to the Solr store
with the following line:

$wgWBSettings['defaultStore'] = 'solrstore';

You can also if you like include the solr special search page,
but this is only for testing and deving. This shouldn't be
in the deployment version at all.

require_once( "$IP/extensions/Wikibase/repo/includes/specials/SpecialSolrSearch.php" );
$wgSpecialPages['SolrSearch'] = 'SpecialSolrSearch';
