Users can see it in JavaScript file names and CSS classes.\n\nBasically: imagine we give the user a term, but we don\u0027t tell him if it\u0027s a label, description, alias, or whatnot. That term is entirely useless then.\n\nI wanted to avoid the word \"term\" here in this document, but the example really is the best entitytype-specific example we have, and it can not be shown without mentioning the word \"term\".",
