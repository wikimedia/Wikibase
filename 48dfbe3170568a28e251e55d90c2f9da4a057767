That\u0027d still be bad, though not a concern of this class, and something that is not its responsibility for fixing.\n\nAn alternative would be to use a decorator. That still results in a somewhat hard to deal with decorated class, however the non decorated one will not be polluted and remain as simple as it should be, which is the most important thing here.",

This object does not represent a language (though it might represent something like a Language object (which would be a bad description)). It is something responsible for translating, so Translator would be a better name. What about having a Translator interface that does not expose fallback specific stuff, and a TranslatorWithLanguageFallback that implements it?",

To use it, take an item in fallback chain (no matter what it is), fetch data from language -\u003egetFetchLanguage(), then feed data to -\u003etranslate() and use the results.
