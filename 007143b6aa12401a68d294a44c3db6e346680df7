Assuming that $( \u0027#wbclient-linkItem-page\u0027 ) is set on the page is just like accessing a global.",

Personally, I like the non-indented style better since you end up with less levels of indention and use indention where it really benefits readability; mainly for control structures and long function calls where the chained functions don\u0027t relate to the chain\u0027s bottom object.",
