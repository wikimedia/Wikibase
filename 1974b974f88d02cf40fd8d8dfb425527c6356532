What this means is: The comparison will fail if a whitespace or any other irrelevant formatting detail in the â€¦.expected file is not exactly the same as the output produced by this json_encode. But such details are irrelevant and should not make this test fail.\n\nTL;DR: This patch changes the test so it does not compare the decoded JSON any more, but the encoded and JSON string including all formatting details. I think this is not an improvement, and should not be done.",
