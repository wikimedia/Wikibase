      "message": "I think the use of comma-separator message is a bit odd.\nIn English this is odd, and using a dash was better (although not perfect, and completely bad in terms of i18n).\n\nAs discussed in the patch that introduced this new special page, I was considering a dedicated message for the whole \"badge line\", where title (or link), and description would be passed as parameters. That way we would ensure that the list looks fine in all languages, using separators specific to a particular language, or any other specific things if there were any.\nThat was only the rough idea. I was about to implement it soon. I can base on top of other changes you\u0027ve done here. But I think changing \" - \" to colon-separator does not change much regarding i18n issues here, to be honest.",

I did not wanted to introduce one just for this case, when there are already so many we can pick from. I\u0027m fine with using \"colon-separator\", but found a comma a little more appealing, and more in symmetry with existing code.",

      "message": "sorry, I meant comma-separator.\n\nBut yeah, colon probably slipped through as I can see it fitting better than comma-space combination in some languages.\n\nThe general problem with deciding to use a particular separator here (be it comma, colon, dash, does not matter) I see is that this is assuming a particular type of separator is universal among languages. I don\u0027t think this is valid assumption.\nOn the other hand, as you say, there are places in Wikibase that already do use comma-separator, so doing something special for this special page would not solve the issue as a whole.",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this is worth the trouble. I don\u0027t think this special page is worth *any* trouble.\n\nThe default styling of a definition list is quite odd: a line break, the first line bold, the second line indented for no obvious reason. This is very uncommon for a special page and will need custom CSS to make it fit the users expectations. And the moment we go this route we need to update other special pages and other places in our code that also display descriptions the same way.\n\nAll I really wanted to do is to fix an actual HTML injection, and to replace a hard coded \" - \" with a localizable message, whatever that message is. That\u0027s really all that is needed to do here, and really all we should do at the moment. Can we please merge this patch and invest our precious time on more important stuff?\n\nShould I split this patch?\n\nShould I remove the message and add the hard coded \" - \" back?",

      "message": "Definition list could work, although yeah, it is a bit different from what was here originally. But might be OK. I am not sure.\n\n@Thiemo:\n\nWell, I believe it is matter of opinion. To me making a UI that is accessible for all people, and not English-centered (or any-other-language/culture-centered) is worth any trouble. I don\u0027t expect everyone to share my view, though.\n\nI was just raising concerns, that we might be replacing one way of displaying the data that might be not natural for some users, with another way having a similar problem. As stated, the issue is not trivial, and I don\u0027t expect we\u0027ll find a perfect solution here.\n\n\u003e replace a hard coded \" - \" with a localizable message, whatever that message is. That\u0027s really all that is needed to do here, and really all we should do at the moment. \n\nThis is an arguable statement.\n\n\u003e Should I split this patch?\n\nI am fine with what\u0027s here now.\n\n\u003e Should I remove the message and add the hard coded \" - \" back?\n\nI\u0027d be fine either way. I don\u0027t think none of those two is significantly \"better\". Whatever stays would be fine for now.\n\nI didn\u0027t have time to look at the whole patch yet. While briefly looking at this, I\u0027ve spotted this, and thus commented. I will look at other changes and review the whole patch when I have time.",
