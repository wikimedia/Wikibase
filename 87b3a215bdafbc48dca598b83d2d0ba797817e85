      "message": "The problem with this approach is that it will \"succeed\" for all property id strings, no matter if they exist or not. But it will fail if you are asking for a label that does not exist.\n\nShort: Labels may exist or not. Property ids always exist. This is an odd combination of two very different things in a single service.\n\nI\u0027m not sure if this should be called a \"resolver\". Can we find a better name?",
