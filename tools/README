The tools folder of Wikibase has scripts for running runJobs.php as a daemon process.

To use these on an Ubuntu setup:

1) create a config file in /etc/wikibase.conf and include your MW install directory, such as:

MW_INSTALL_DIR="/var/www/common/wikidata-client"

2) jobs-run.sh should be put in /usr/local/bin

3) jobrunner goes in /etc/init.d

The jobs-run.sh can be put somewhere else that is accessible in $PATH and then
adjust the jobrunner (in init.d) accordingly.

These are simplified scripts for running the jobs. The scripts are based on the jobrunner scripts
used by the Wikimedia Foundation.

The original job runner scripts can be found in the modules/mediawiki_new folder of the puppet repo:
