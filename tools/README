The tools folder of Wikibase has scripts for running pollForChanges and runJobs as a daemon process.

To use these on an Ubuntu setup:

1) create a config file in /etc/wikibase.conf and include your MW install directory, such as:

MW_INSTALL_DIR="/var/www/common/wikidata-client"

2) jobs-run.sh and pollchanges.sh go in /usr/local/bin

3) wbpollchanges and jobrunner go in /etc/init.d


CREDITS

These are simplified scripts for running the jobs. The scripts are based on the jobrunner scripts
used by the Wikimedia Foundation.

The original job runner scripts can be found in the modules/mediawiki_new folder of the puppet repo:
