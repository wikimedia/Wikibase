      "message": "The need to do this indicates a design problem with the code under test. Normally I\u0027d advocate for fixing that. This is not possible here though, as this is forced upon us as part of a legacy API we do not control. We of course still need to test if we are using this API correctly, though this can be done through integration  tests, that treat the legacy API as a black box, and thus have minimal binding to it.",

      "message": "Why is this static?\n\ntypical naming is fooBarProvider\n\nPlease keep valid and invalid test cases separate. This is part of the general notion that one should have a test case per desired characteristic, not one per method. For an example, see the tests in the DataValues Serialization component. If I now read one of these method names, I know it tests method x, and then need to go try figure out what behaviours it is actually testing.",
