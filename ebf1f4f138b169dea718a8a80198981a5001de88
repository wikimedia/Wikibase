      "message": "This is a bit confusing. I think it would be best to clearly distinguish between MW permissions and WB permissions, and make sure we never mix them. I believe lack of this distinction has caused the present confusion.\n\nIf we do that, callers would ask for \"create\" for an Item or \"term\" for a Property or \"merge\" for a Lexeme, and it would be this classe\u0027s responsibility to determine which MW permissions to check.\n\nE.g. \"merge\" for a Lexeme will check \"lexeme-merge\" and \"edit\". \"redirect\" for a Lexeme will check \"lexeme-redirect\" and \"edit\". We could also have \"entity-redirect\".",
