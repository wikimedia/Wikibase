== Package ==

The Wikibase package consists of three interconnected extensions:

* Wikibase Repository (in the directory repo)
* Wikibase Client (in the directory client)
* WikibaseLib (in the directory lib)

== About ==

These extensions allow for the creation, maintenance, dissemination,
and usage of structured data in MediaWiki.

The repo is the extension for the repository. It allows the creation and maintenance of structured data. This is
being used on wikidata.org.

The client is the extension for the client. It allows several MediaWiki instances to use data provided by a Wikidata
instance. Usually, you would not use them in a single wiki. This is being used on the Wikipedias.

The lib bundles common code that is used by both the client and the repo.

Note that in each of the directories you will also find README notes for each of the extensions.

== Wikidata ==

These extensions where created by the Wikidata team for the Wikidata project.
