I would\u0027ve expected this to be called something like `batchResolveTermIds` or resolveTermIdsInBatch` as it resolves \"grouped\" term ids in \"one\" batch (here batch refers to one access to the backend storage of the implementation) instead of doing multiple ones if one would use resolveTermIds() for each group. does that make any sense to you too?",

      "message": "Yeah I wasn’t too happy with the name either… but in the database implementation we need a name for the key of the outer array, and currently I’ve used “batch” for that. With `batchResolveTermIds` or `resolveTermIdsInBatch` that doesn’t work so well anymore, I think. I’ll try to see if I can find another pattern that works.",

      "message": "Yeap when I read the next patch in chain I felt the same. If it helps, I\u0027ll share how I read it again in my head:\nI thought of them in terms of grouping rather than batches .. so each entry in the array of arrays is a group of term ids (as in each entry is a group of term ids that are grouped by some keys that have meaning to the outside caller)..\nthen we can refer to it internally as `groupKey \u003d\u003e groupTermIds`. It is a bit generic but kinda worked for me when I was reading it in my head.",
