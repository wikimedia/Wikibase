I would\u0027ve expected this to be called something like `batchResolveTermIds` or resolveTermIdsInBatch` as it resolves \"grouped\" term ids in \"one\" batch (here batch refers to one access to the backend storage of the implementation) instead of doing multiple ones if one would use resolveTermIds() for each group. does that make any sense to you too?",

      "message": "Yeah I wasn’t too happy with the name either… but in the database implementation we need a name for the key of the outer array, and currently I’ve used “batch” for that. With `batchResolveTermIds` or `resolveTermIdsInBatch` that doesn’t work so well anymore, I think. I’ll try to see if I can find another pattern that works.",
