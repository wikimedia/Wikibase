The 2nd parameter does not become part of the array when it is omitted, but does when the caller passes \"null\", even if the resulting $data value is \"null\" in both cases. I find it better to not have this optional \"null\" here. See the old implementation in https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-Wikibase/commit/7bc3422de31d5949dbc46e0771a3cc981e420ff3",
