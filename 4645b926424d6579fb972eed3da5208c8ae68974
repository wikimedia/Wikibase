      "message": "I also wondered if this is the best idea of copying an Entity but I just wanted to replicate the current behaviour. I\u0027m not sure what alternatives we could use.\n\nOne idea would be to return copies of the actual objects in the getters (like `getStatements`, `getFingerprint` etc.) so that those objects aren\u0027t the same as in the Entity object. Then we can safely use `clone` because all modifications on `Entity` have to be made using setters and won\u0027t modify the original `Entity` object.",
