      "message": "I find this interface rather weird before this change already.\n\nIf you have a good collection, then like with value objects, there is little reason to have an interface. They just contain a pile of simple objects, and do not have complex dependencies or logic that you might want to mock out or use a different implementation of.\n\nThe getName method seems better suited for a service. The comment even implies it is in a service.\n\nIf there is need for a collection of content languages, then consider creating a simple collection class for this that has no interface. And if you need service like behaviour, then consider putting it into a dedicated service that has an appropriate name.",
