      "message": "This code is odd. At this point this can be any parser. All we know is that it returns an entity id. But the format of the input is a mystery. There are several references to \"URIs\" in this class. But in fact this class can not know.\n\nI think it should now. I think it must require a specific parser in the constructor (or not require it at all, just use it).",
