      "message": "Why did you raise the question in the comment if you already have an opinion? However, in my opinion, you should only have compatibility to what you are aware of - everything else just works by accident. At least, there should be a comment why this compatibility is needed / which component may return the abnormal structure. Without a comment, everybody stumbling over these lines will wonder why they are necessary and whether they may be removed - basically adding confusion and complexity.",
