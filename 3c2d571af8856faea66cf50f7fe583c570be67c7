The second longest is WikibaseRepo::getMonolingualTextLanguages.\n\nThis makes me happy (we are quite good in producing readable code), but a bit sad the same time (search related code I see tends to look notably different from Wikibase code).\n\nCan you please refactor this code and split it into logical elements with self-documenting names?
