All you need to know to render a description/title is the ItemId of the badge. You don\u0027t need the options array to render the titles.\n\nCheck the title/description for all badges (no matter if they have a class name or not) and render either the first or the last (I think it should be the last).\n\nRender all class names and let the CSS decide which one is more important.",

      "message": "Actually I strongly discourage to depend on the order of the badges as they are stored because this order is in no way reliable nor is it the way communities will want it to happen.\n\nWe already decided to use the order in the config for that purpose so this is the way to go. It also does not make sense to add the title for a badge and use the css for another one. To prevent such a confusing and wrong situation we have to restrict the display this way.",

However, I suggest to use the item\u0027s label, not the description (this is actually the intended use case for titles; descriptions are just for disambiguation). If multiple badges apply, they should be joined using Language::commaList or Language::semicolonList.",
