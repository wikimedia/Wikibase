All you need to know to render a description/title is the ItemId of the badge. You don\u0027t need the options array to render the titles.\n\nCheck the title/description for all badges (no matter if they have a class name or not) and render either the first or the last (I think it should be the last).\n\nRender all class names and let the CSS decide which one is more important.",

It also does not make sense to add the title for a badge and use the css for another one. To prevent such a confusing and wrong situation we have to restrict the display this way.",

If multiple badges apply, they should be joined using Language::commaList or Language::semicolonList.",

      "message": "The title only applies only to the icon an nothing else so title and icon are strongly connected. The \u0027itemtitle\u0027 attribute adds a title to the \u003cli\u003e element so the title is also on the list-icon but the link inside the \u003cli\u003e has its own title added by MediaWiki so the \u0027itemtitle\u0027 is indeed only visible in the icon. This concludes in my opinion that we should avoid confusing things and only add a title fitting to the icon it belongs to.",

Also, we don\u0027t even know that the way the status is indicated will actually be an icon. Having the title with all the info here is consistent with having all the classes here, and is potentially useful for processing by JS.\n\nIf you want to make a one-icon-one-title thing, you\u0027d have to generate the icons in php, apply one title for each, but could generate multiple icons. That\u0027s possible, but takes away a lot of freedom from the wiki admins.",
