This is especially true for the installations run by Wikimedia. Either get the PID file from the command line, or use something like wfWikiID().",

      "message": "Under *nix, it would be nicer to use a file in /var/run (you will see a whole bunch of .pid files there already). The file in /var/run would need to be created and chowned to the correct user for that to work though. \n\nSo: try to use /var/run/xyz under *nix (or just check if that directory exists), otherwise use the OS\u0027 temp dir.",
