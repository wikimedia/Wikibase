      "message": "This is becoming a big garbage bin. 11 fields is beyond suspicious.\n\nLooking at the newly added method I can see it only uses these two fields and does not interact with existing fields or methods. Which is a sign of low cohesion. Furthermore the added fields are only used by the new method, a sign of the same issue.\n\nThat is a lot of signs of bad design. And this commit seems to continue down that path :(",
