So I think I disagree with David here - we shouldn\u0027t check anything, and if it\u0027s not indexed, then the search won\u0027t find anything. It\u0027s not a problem.",

      "message": "As far as I can see in the code only Statements where Statement::getMainSnak()::getPropertyId()::getSerialization() returns a value that is in the array $GLOBALS[\u0027wgWBRepoSettings\u0027][\u0027searchIndexProperties\u0027] can get indexed, so I think this is correct\n\nPerhaps I\u0027m missing something? Or perhaps a variable is poorly named/commented?\n\nI think David\u0027s concern about users is fair - a user is likely to be puzzled if they search for haswbstatement:P999\u003dQ88 and get no results, even though they *know* that item X has the statement P999\u003dQ888",

      "message": "This is correct in the current code, where the only properties indexed are those in searchIndexProperties. However, with https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T99899 and https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/427836/ it is going to change, and in general we won\u0027t have a fixed list of properties that we index. \n\n\u003e a user is likely to be puzzled if they search for haswbstatement:P999\u003dQ88 and get no results, even though they *know* that item X has the statement P999\u003dQ888\n\nIf the property is not indexed, then it won\u0027t be found. This is true for all searches - if you don\u0027t index something, you don\u0027t find it. I don\u0027t see how anything changes here. We may need some docs on it, but using searchIndexProperties is not going to work.",
