      "message": "That would still use global state and since I think the whole \"generic entity stuff\" pattern is harmful, I am not keen on using that mechanism. On top of that it is also more complicated than just using a hook.\n\nThe global state issue can be solved by using a sanely designed event dispatcher. Easy to write ourself (\u003c50 LLOC) or we can use an existing lib (like Symfony Event Dispatcher), as per my recent mail to the list.",
