      "message": "I believe this change is fine.\n\nIn both cases, the entity ID is passed as the first element in the getCommentArgs array, which will end as $3 in the message.\n\nFor reference, the two messages are:\n* \"Merged item from $3\"\n* \"Merged item into $3\"\n\nWith the old code, $3 was just the ID string, e.g. \"Q1\". With the new code, it is a wikitext snippet with an unlabeled link, e.g. \"[[Item:Q1]]\" or \"[[Q1]]\", depending on the namespace setup.\n\nEven if this link is not labeled (which can\u0027t work anyway for the entity that is not a redirect), having the link alone is an improvement.",
