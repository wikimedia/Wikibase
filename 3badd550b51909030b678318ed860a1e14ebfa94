      "message": "This is a new one.\nAfter this special page class got refactored so its dependencies are injected, it was also getting an instance of BufferingTermLookup.\nNow with Repo getting dispatching services from Client, WikibaseRepo::getBuffeingTermLookup is returning the DispatchingTermBuffer instance (and still a BufferingTermLookup as before when no Client not enabled).\n\nSo I\u0027ve changed this to accept PrefetchingTermLookup which is an interface which both BufferingTermLookup and DispatchingTermBuffer implement.\n\nI believe WikibaseRepo::getBufferingTermLookup should also become getPrefetchingTermLookup now. So renaming this as well.",
