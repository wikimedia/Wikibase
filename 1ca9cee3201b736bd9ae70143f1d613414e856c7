      "message": "Respect? ;-) Something wrong with $httpResponseCode? You just saved 4 characters in a 12 character variable name. Not a reason to block this but I don\u0027t like such variable names, sorry.\n\n\u003e \u003e I suggest [...] to return the exceptions instead\n\u003e Wouldn\u0027t that cause the exception to contain the wrong stack trace\n\nI tried and the stack trace is actually 1 line smaller when you do \"throw getFoo()\" instead of \"throwFoo()\".\n\n\u003e in terms of flow control, \"throw\" is of course more clear.\n\nI think Jeroen already started to call these thing throwFoo().\n\n\u003e I can still be convinced of a better approach.\n\nYes, we should continue talking about this. But as I said, not in this patch please.",
