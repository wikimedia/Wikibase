      "message": "That patch removes the PARSER_PURGE_ACTION constant and the corresponding method in the PageUpdater interface. It has been conflated with LINKS_UDPATE_ACTION. There is simply no use case for doing one but not the other. The change in WikiPageUpdater is a consequence of this.\n\nAnyway, all the4se flags are not really needed, I\u0027ll get rid of it soon.",
