      "message": "Hmm. This works because redirections are processed left-to-right, so `cat LocalSettings.php` is executed before the `\u003e LocalSettings.php` clobbers the file. I’m not quite comfortable with this, to be honest… if anyone changes the `cat` line to `cat \u003e LocalSettings.php \u003c\u003c-PHP`, perhaps just for aesthetic reasons, then suddenly this will be broken.\n\nSomething like this could be used instead:\n\n cat - LocalSettings.php \u003e LocalSettings.php.1 \u003c\u003c \u0027PHP\u0027\n \u003c?php\n // mw-apply-wb-settings.php\n # etc.\n PHP\n mv LocalSettings.php.1 LocalSettings.php",
