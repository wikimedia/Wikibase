There are two kinds of query modules, one for generating lists of titles (registered in $wgAPIListModules) and one for adding properties to a list of titles  (registered in $wgAPIPropModules). They are opposites of each other: one would find all pages that use specific entitites, the other would tell you which entitites are used by a specific set of pages. \n\nRenaming this to ApiPropsEntityUsage is misleading.",
