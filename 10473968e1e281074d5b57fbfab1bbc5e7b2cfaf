      "message": "This is needlessly hard-coding the fact that every page must have a main slot. The check for the main slot should not be needed at all: in the current situation, you\u0027d keep the EDIT_NEW flag simply because $parentRevision would be null if there is no main slot. But the code here doesn\u0027t have to know about that.\n\nAlso, SlotRecord::MAIN exists in core now.",
