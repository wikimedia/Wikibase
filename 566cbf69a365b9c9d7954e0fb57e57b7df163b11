      "message": "this switch could be split into its own method to increase readability and reduce the indenting here. Something such as getEntryFromTerm thus it could be reduced to\n$entries[$numericId] \u003d $this-\u003egetEntryFromTerm( $term )\n\nOther than that this generally looks good. The only other way to improve this further would be to refactor Term-\u003egetEntityId to actually return an entity id..",
