Look how this method is used. Look where it lives. It\u0027s just convenient to be able to call $this-\u003eentityExists( $entityDocument-\u003egetId() ) and get a useful false instead of a runtime error that need to be try-catched or checked before calling the method with not-null-if\u0027s all over the place.
