      "message": "They work separately, and the address different concerns. This code was added to ensure that this patch leaves the code base in a functional state even if the next patch is not applied.\n\nI personally find it easier to review smaller patches that address a single concern. I also find that smaller patches are easier to revert. That of course only works if the codebase is functional after each individual patch - which is why I added this code.\n\nI can squash the patches if you prefer, but I find that counter to the goals of easy review and revertability.",
