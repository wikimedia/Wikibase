If the indexes are relevant, that should be specified, too.\n\nHowever, I\u0027m not sure we really want to guarantee one-builder-per-entity-type. I think this interface should only guarantee that you get all relevant builders.",

But this is not super crucial IMO, as this is a private method, and docs of public method mention that fact.\n\nWhether it is important/needed/good to have those builders per entity type is still a question to me but it is fine for now I guess.",
