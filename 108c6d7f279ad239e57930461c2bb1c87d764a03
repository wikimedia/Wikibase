      "message": "Old thing was fine too, just the fact that returned array is indexed by entity type could be also mentioned somehow. But this is not super crucial IMO, as this is a private method, and docs of public method mention that fact.\n\nWhether it is important/needed/good to have those builders per entity type is still a question to me but it is fine for now I guess.",

When talking about having null/instanceof check here I was referring to the thing the $callback returns (i.e. to thing call_user_func below returns).",
