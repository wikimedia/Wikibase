That indicates that it\u0027s defined in the wrong place. \n\nPerhaps applying the fallback could be done by a decorator implementing the same interface. Maybe we need two interfaces: one for getting \"the\" label (and description), applying knowledge about language and language fallback; another for just getting all labels (resp Descriptions), possibly for a fixed list of languages.",
