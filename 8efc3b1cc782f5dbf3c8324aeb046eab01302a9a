I actually don\u0027t like and think it would be better to require to explicitly have two callbacks in entity type definition.\nWith this kind fallback, definitions of items and properties don\u0027t need to be changed. OTOH a possibility to provide storage-serializer-factory-callback is more hidden that way.",
