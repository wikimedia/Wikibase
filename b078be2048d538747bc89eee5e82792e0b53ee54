      "message": "It is. Do you have a suggestion how to mitigate this? I tried out passing in a ValueViewBuilder instead of constructing it in this class. Five of these eight dependencies are only used for constructing the ValueViewBuilder. However, I would like to use the messageProvider in the EntityViews as well, so that\u0027s one less we could remove when passing ValueViewBuilder. If we would have an ExpertFactory, contentLanguages could be a dependency of that factory, instead of being passed to the ValueViewBuilder. That would mean we could replace expertStore and contentLanguages with expertFactory.\n\nAny general ideas how to approach such situations?",
