We can also revert the whole chain of patches if you prefer.\n* TermSqlIndex does support all numeric entity types.\n* If there is a configuration somewhere that restricts the wb_terms table to specific entity types, the same configuration must be used here. Please point me to the relevant configuration so I can fix this patch.",
