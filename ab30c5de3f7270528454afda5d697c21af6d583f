      "message": "Having a database connection as a member should generally be avoided, since it makes connection pooling and re-use impossible (important when accessing information on multiple wikis). Instead, have the database (wiki) name as a member (and perhaps also the server id, i.e. DB_SLAVE or DB_MASTER), and get a connection for that wiki on demand.\n\nFor short lived objects this is not terribly important, so it can be ignored here. But please keep it in mind for the general case.",
