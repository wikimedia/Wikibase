      "message": "I\u0027m not convinced by this rationale. Narrow public interfaces are good, but using php interfaces as extension points is problematic for versioning, see T193613. Base classes make less brittle extension points.\n\nOn the other hand, using composition (strategy pattern) here seems fine, even though perhaps it\u0027s not needed. I\u0027d recommend a base class anyway.",

      "message": "It would allow a third method to be added with a default implementation, without a breaking change. There is no backwards compatible way to add anything to an interface. When an interface is used as an extension point, it can never be extended, it becomes immutable. It can only be replaced. The the discussion on the ticket.",
