So \u0027for-language\u0027 is before the fallback, \u0027source-language\u0027 is after the fallback, and \u0027language\u0027 is after transliteration?\n\nThis should really be documented somewhere. Is there any high level documentation somewhere, describing the entire process, terminology, etc?",
