There is no choice. PHPUnit calls these methods statically, always. Defining them other wise will only cause 2 things: 1) Confusion (it might make a future contributor think $this can be used, which will break the function), 2) A strict violation (depending on your debug settings).\n* We don\u0027t care about what the  _manual_ says.
