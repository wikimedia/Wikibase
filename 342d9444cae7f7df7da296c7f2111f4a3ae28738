      "message": "Weird, not really useful interface. This doesn\u0027t (and probably can\u0027t) really explain what this actually does. In which case is it acceptable to (for example) show a \"delete\" button to a user that doesn\u0027t have the permission? Or even worse, do the opposite, *not* show a button to a user that does have the permission. If I had to use this interface I would never ever use a parameter that obviously leads to wrong results.\n\nOr:\n\nIf this is supposed to be used for the $doExpensiveQueries parameter in the Title class why don\u0027t you keep that name? $relaxed does have a very different meaning. $doExpensiveQueries is about speed/performance/resources. $relaxed is more like \"I don\u0027t really care for no particular reason\".",
