      "message": "Weird, not really useful interface. This doesn\u0027t (and probably can\u0027t) really explain what this actually does. In which case is it acceptable to (for example) show a \"delete\" button to a user that doesn\u0027t have the permission? Or even worse, do the opposite, *not* show a button to a user that does have the permission. If I had to use this interface I would never ever use a parameter that obviously leads to wrong results.\n\nOr:\n\nIf this is supposed to be used for the $doExpensiveQueries parameter in the Title class why don\u0027t you keep that name? $relaxed does have a very different meaning. $doExpensiveQueries is about speed/performance/resources. $relaxed is more like \"I don\u0027t really care for no particular reason\".",

      "message": "\"$doExpensiveQueries\" is indeed about resources. It indicates that the caller should know whether expensive queries should be performed. This means leaking implementation details through the interface.\n\nI prefer the caller indicates the requirements (\"need this to be strict\" vs. \"I don\u0027t care so much\") and leave it to the implementation to decide what to do.\n\nThe intention is indeed that the caller can specify requirements, so the implementation can optimize.",
