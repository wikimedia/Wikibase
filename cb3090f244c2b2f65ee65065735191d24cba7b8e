      "message": "The call WikibaseRepo::getDefaultInstance()-\u003egetLanguageFallbackChainFa\nctory() should be in the constructor, setting the member $this-\u003elanguageFallbackChainFactory.\n\nThis is a good practice that makes it easier to later implement proper injection. It also allows us to provide a setLanguageFallbackChainFactory() method that could be used by tests to provide a \"fake\" factory. We should make it as easy as possible to \"detach\" from the rest of the framework.",
