      "message": "I don\u0027t really like this approach. It implies something is buffered internally, and needs to be explicitly triggered for output. That goes against the idea behind this interface.\n\nThe same thing can be achieved using transparent internal buffering though, as is already implemented for RDF/XML. I\u0027d much prefer this approach.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure what is \"transparent internal buffering\" but I don\u0027t see what is the problem with specifying at which point you want to add prefixes. If you have better idea please add the patch, but this provides significant performance improvement against scanning output for prefixes.",

      "message": "shorthands needs to be gone anyway, but I don\u0027t see any problem with writers knowing they have prefixes. They do it anyway since you have getPrefixes(), which is the same thing only slower. I do not anticipate we will evert have getPrefixes() return something that is not $this-\u003eprefixes, so I\u0027d prefer not to complicate and slow down things in anticipation of some abstract change that will never happen.",
