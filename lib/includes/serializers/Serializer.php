/**
 * Interface for objects that can transform variables of a certain type into an array
 * of primitive value or nested arrays. This output can then be fed to a serialization
 * function such as json_encode() or serialize(). The format used is suitable for
 * exposure to the outside world, so can be used in APIs, be put into pages as
 * JSON blobs to be used by widgets or by an exporter. The formats are not optimized
 * for conciseness and can contain a lot of redundant info, and are thus often not
 * ideal for serialization for internal storage.
