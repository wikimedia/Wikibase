Since the commit is merged, it can be removed.\n\nFor future reference, as far as I know, Depends-On is used to specify dependencies from another repository. There\u0027s no need to use it if a commit depends on another commit from the same repository. You can just create a branch with several commits, and push them all to gerrit. It will automatically recognize parent and child commits, using power of git. ;)",
