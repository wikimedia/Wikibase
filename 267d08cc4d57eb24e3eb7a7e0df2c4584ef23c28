Now it depends on the implementation of the Item class. Maybe Jeroen or Daniel do have an opinion?\n\nThe good thing is: this change removes duplicate data.",

      "message": "I think removing duplicate data is worthier than needing less dependencies here. Furthermore, we can depend, maybe we even should depend on the implementation of Item because it is something we depend on anyway. We do not have to check that Item serializes SiteLinks correctly in this test because this is done in other tests. So a dependency on Item does not matter imho.",
