* (If used as MediaWiki extension: MediaWiki 1.16 or later)

== Download ==

git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/p/mediawiki/extensions/Diff.git

== Installation as MediaWiki extension ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''Diff'' directory within your MediaWiki
'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# Diff
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Diff/Diff.php" );

== Installation as standalone library ==

Include Diff/Diff.standalone.php. This file includes an autoloader allowing you to directly
reference the diff classes without first including their files. If you want to use your
own autoloader, you can find the list of diff classes in Diff/Diff.classes.php.
