While that might mean we avoid this for hot code, we\u0027re currently interested in measuring code that is quite hot. Overhead should be kept to a minimum for that, and where possible not change the stack itself.\n\nA few alternative ideas.\n\nStart and end:\n\n $id \u003d $this-\u003eprofiler-\u003estart( $type . \u0027.EditFilterHookRunner.run\u0027 );\n // ...\n $this-\u003eprofiler-\u003eendId( $id );\n\n\nScoped timer (automatic end):\n\n $scopedTimer \u003d $this-\u003eprofiler-\u003escopedStart( $type . \u0027.EditFilterHookRunner.run\u0027 );",
