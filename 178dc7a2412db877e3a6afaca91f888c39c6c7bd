While it\u0027s quite possible that we\u0027d want dofferent limits for different kinds of queries, I\u0027d go with $this-\u003ebatchSize until we have a concrete reason no to. \n\nEven if we want different limits, they may be relative to each other - e.g. union chunk size could be batchSize/3+1 or something.",
