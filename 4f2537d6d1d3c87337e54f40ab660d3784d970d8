      "message": "Just a few months ago I got a -1 for doing exactly that. I was told that the provider returns exactly these two arguments and all tests using the provider should list all parameters, even if they are unused in the test. Today I agree with that: list all arguments. Not really relevant in this case, but this makes me wonder: will we change details like this back and forth every time somebody feels like?",
