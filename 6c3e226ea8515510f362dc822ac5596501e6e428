Similarly, it will need the RdfVocabulary.\n\nIt should probably also know the desired output flavor.\n\nThe factory may also need to know the entity type to decide what EntityRdfBuilders are needed. Perhaps it would even be better to supply the concrete Entity object, so the factory can check which interfaces it implements.\n\nCOmpare the signature of ValueSnakRdfBuilderFactory::getValueSnakRdfBuilder",
