      "message": "oh, the case of other extension classes is interesting.\nIt seems a quick way to \"fix\" the problem is adding \u0027../../extensions/Scribunto/engines\u0027 to dir list(s) but I am not sure if this is a best way to go. What if some extension changes its directory structure? And what about cases I want to run Phan locally but don\u0027t have Scribunto, Echo, whatever else extension installed (because I don\u0027t need it) - Phan would show a warning when directory is not there (might not be such a big deal, though).\nMaybe there are better ways deal with this? Maybe core\u0027s config/script should handle it somehow?",
