      "message": "I realize testing special pages isn\u0027t easy but am somewhat dissatisfied by not having not having much tests for the special page.\n\nI think most of the logic in the special page class can be put into it\u0027s own class, with the dependencies injected more nicely and arguments passed to it.\n\nthen it is probably much easier to have tests to cover more aspects, with a mock PropertyInfoStore thing.  The tests would also run faster :)",
