      "message": "We generally use a setting for enabling the usage of new database columns. Not sure how expensive fieldExists is... I suppose it\u0027s an additional query/round-trip. At the very least, put this into a member variable that is lazy-initialized and re-used. Ideally, require this to be set in the constructor and take this info from the XyzStore (which will get it from the settings somehow).",
