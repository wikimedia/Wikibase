      "message": "The mock injects non-integers here. The if is a fail safe, otherwise the code below would do very odd things.\n\nThis method is used to format the precision (e.g. \"1 year\" with the default $amount of 1) as well as the before and after values (e.g. \"2 years\" with an $amount of 2).\n\nIf $amount is the default value, skip it and output only the $precision. Otherwise output only the $amount. This is the old behavior of the formatter before I introduced this method.",
