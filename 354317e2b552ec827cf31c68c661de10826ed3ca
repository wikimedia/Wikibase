I had two options:\n* Just remove this line.\n* Change the mode from plain text (which is the default) to \"rich-wikitext\".\n\nI decided to go with the later option, because this makes this test here kind of an integration test. I removed the \"T\" usages from all other tests. So now both cases are tested. That would not be the case if I remove the \"T\" everywhere.",
