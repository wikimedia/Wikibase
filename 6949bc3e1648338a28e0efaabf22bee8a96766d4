I think it\u0027s a good idea to have such \"testers\", at least if there is more than one implementation.\n\nI\u0027m a bit annoyed by the fact that we can\u0027t use it here - the reason is that this implementation technically breaks the assumption that usages other than sitelinks are tracked. I\u0027ll think about it.",
