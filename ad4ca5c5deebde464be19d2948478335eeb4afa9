      "message": "Most of this block is clutter. Lets please stick with one comment block, not two. author and license can go in the same one as where we have the description, like we are doing elsewhere. You are also changing position of namespace and use statements, which we usually have at the top.\n\nThis comes of as very sloppy. For instance, why is there a space before the start of the comment block? And the date, that makes no sense.",

      "message": "Hm... to me it makes sense to keep the comment blocks for the file and the class separate. The file level one is about authorship/license stuff, the class level one is about the actual class. It also makes it easier to set up templates that work for files with and without class declaration.\n\nThe date is horrible - apparently PHPStorm uses the OS\u0027s locale to format the date, which gives me a (lightly broken) German-style date in an English comment.  Ugh.",
