      "message": "It is not crucial, but a bit difficult to read because subject and some other sentence parts are missing. I would suggest one of:\n  * WhenExecutedThenExceptionIsThrown (here subject also but it is assumed that we speak about test case\u0027s target - SpecialEntityPage)\n  * executeMethodCalledExceptionIsThrown\n  * executeMethodThrowsException\n\nOn another topic:\nI would say that we don\u0027t actually check that exception is thrown but that certain response is returned, or, may be, that the error message is being displayed. So the test name might be: `WhenExecutedDisplaysPageWith400ResponseCode` or `WhenExecuted_BadEntityIdErrorIsDisplayed`",

      "message": "Will it throw exception if the message record not found? If not, then I guess it would be easier to use \u0027qqx\u0027 language and assert against raw keys. \n\nOr, if you want to check that you didn\u0027t forget to add language records then I would suggest to assert against exact text (may be not exact but `contains`), but not `wfMessage( \u0027xxx\u0027 )-\u003etext()` construct.\n\nSee `\\LanguageQqx`",
