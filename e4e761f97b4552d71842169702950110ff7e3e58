      "message": "Well, it\u0027s possible to move, but the thing is you\u0027d need to call the setter all the time - because the way it works is that you just add a parameter to the request, like cirrusDumpQuery\u003dyes, and that produces the query. For it to work, we need to always have the request.\nThat said, I do not object to moving it to setter, if you prefer, just be aware that this setter will be called in mainline scenario at least. And probably is some tests too.",
