      "message": "The idea is to avoid building data structures, and apply filtering on the fly. Iterating and filtering a second time (or third, or forth) just seems simpler to implement. The performance impact should be minimal.\n\nMy approach however assumes that we would hard code which sections exist, and what filters they use. If we want this to be configurable, the grouping approach is probably easier.\n\nNote however that inside the section view, another level of grouping (by property ID) is applied. This is somewhat confusing, it would be nice to use the same mechanism on both levels.",

When the first section contains all non-deprecated identifiers, and the second section contains all time values that have at least one reference, how would the filter for the third section look? Something like NOT( OR( filter1, filter2 ) )? What\u0027s the benefit of that?\n\n\u003e My approach however assumes that we would hard code which sections exist\n\nI do not understand. Why should we hardcode configuration that\u0027s specific to wikidata.org, and not a generic Wikibase concept? I find this sooo obvious, I assumed we all agree on this. Why should every Wikibase based repository be enforced to have a special section for identifiers, but disallowed to have other sections for other data types they introduced?\n\n\u003e it would be nice to use the same mechanism on both levels.\n\nGuess what ByPropertyIdStatementGrouper is for. :-(",

Not any more specific than SiteLinks or References.\n\nIn the end, it\u0027s a question of balancing flexibility vs overhead. Making something configurable is always more difficult than hardcoding it. In this case, I would personally go for hardcoding two sections. But I\u0027m not going to block this story on that question. Having this configurable isn\u0027t bad - I just don\u0027t see a pressing need right now. But since we committed to that investment, fine, let\u0027s get it done.",
