      "message": "If I saw this comma form in Java I\u0027d assume it was because $this-\u003ewrite syncs its arguments to the output stream one by one.  In that case the cost of varargs is much lower than building a new string.  Usually, in fact, it\u0027d be written $this-\u003ewrite( \u0027\"\u0027 )-\u003ewrite( $value )-\u003ewrite( \u0027\"\u0027 ); to avoid the varargs overhead too.  Anyway, why go from varags to string building?",
