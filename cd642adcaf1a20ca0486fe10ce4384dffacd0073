Can we use this._propertyId and this._snakType for all getting purposes, please?\n\nAnd maybe (maybe in an other patch) drop the getter functionality from the two and rename them to updatePropertyId() and updateSnakType() please?",

We might talk about doing it differently, but that would be a huge change we would have to discuss thoroughly. I would enter such a discussion with an aversion against accessing private members directly, though :)",

      "message": "My point is, it\u0027s confusing here in this file because it\u0027s used very inconsistently. Sometimes ._propertyId and ._snakType are accessed and set as variables (which is perfectly fine for private members since they are members of /this/ class, right?). Sometimes they are accessed and set using the methods.\n\nCombined getters/setters are ok if they are used consistently in a predictable way. This file here? No, sorry. There are even set and get methods next to the combined getters/setters. So confusing.\n\nSorry for poking at this, I know it\u0027s actually not part of this change and clearly shouldn\u0027t block it.",

      "message": "That\u0027s why I\u0027m poking this. Accessing private properties from the inside of a class shouldn\u0027t be hidden behind a public getter (that possibly does more than it\u0027s supposed to do) if it doesn\u0027t really add a benefit.\n\nWhen I call something like $var.html() it\u0027s very obvious that it probably does much more than accessing a private property. But if something like this._snakType really is a private property it is - in my opinion - much more straightforward to just use it.\n\nThat\u0027s what I think.",
