      "message": "I find that distinction highly technical, especially since we are dealing with an object generated by calling getMock(). Maybe that should be called getDouble(). In any case: it seems that the terminology is not used consistently anywhere, really. I guess we can do better, but since a double can well be a stub and a mock at the same time, and phpunit refers to such objects as \"mock\" in the API (though it makes a distinction in the documentation), I don\u0027t think we need to be very picky about this.",

If we want to mock the output page, which seems like a good idea, I see no way around having such a complex mock (or stub or double or fake or whatever).",
