      "message": "I\u0027m a bit torn about this... all settings in this file are for the local repository. It seems to make sense to have the configuration for *this* repo at the top level. That is different from the client - the client may have a default repo, but really all repos it accesses are on the same level conceptually.\n\nMaybe it makes more sense to think about the the other way: the repo shouldn\u0027t have a foreignRepositories setting. If it accesses foreign repos, it does so as a client, so they are configured in the client settings.\n\nThis is just off the top of my head, I havn\u0027t thought about the implications in detail. I just notice that our concept of \"client\" still isn\u0027t quite clear.",
