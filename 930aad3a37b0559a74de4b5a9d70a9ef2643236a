      "message": "Having a service container as a member is an anti-pattern, because it makes mocking hard. If you can\u0027t have all the services you need injected, each service should have a separate member variable. The member variables should be initialized from the service container in the constructor or some sort of init method. Setters (or a single overrideServices method) can then be used to override the service objects for testing.",
